# By default, Jekyll builds the posts based upon its category to _site/{category_name}/{filename}/index.html. So, when adding any new post, in url, add `/{category}/{filename}/`. 
# Make sure to add the `/` at last, as this URL is compared with the current page URL to make the selected item bold in side nav bar.
